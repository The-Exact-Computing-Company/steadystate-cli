# DESCRIPTION

**SteadyState** enables multiple developers to collaborate on a code repository in real-time. It provides conflict-free merging of concurrent edits using a 3-way merge algorithm, allowing team members to work on the same files simultaneously without merge conflicts.

The system consists of a backend server that manages sessions and a CLI tool that users interact with. Authentication is handled via GitHub OAuth.

# QUICK START

1. Login with GitHub:

```
steadystate login
```

2. Create a collaboration session (host):

```
steadystate up --mode=collab https://github.com/user/repo
```

3. Share the magic link with collaborators.

4. Join a session (collaborator):

```
steadystate join "steadystate://collab/..."
```

5. Make edits, then sync:

```
steadystate sync
```

# EXAMPLES

Create a session for a feature branch:

```
steadystate up --mode=collab --branch=feature-x https://github.com/org/repo
```

Open the dashboard to monitor activity:

```
steadystate dash "steadystate://collab/abc123?ssh=..."
```

View local changes before syncing:

```
steadystate diff
```

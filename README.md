# SteadyState

**SteadyState** is a set of free software tools for creating **reproducible**, **ephemeral**, and
**collaborative** development environments directly from Git repositories. It
consists of two main components:

* **SteadyState CLI** — a Rust-based command-line client used to authenticate,
  launch, and manage sessions.
* **SteadyState Backend** — a Rust/Axum service that handles authentication,
  environment orchestration, and session lifecycle.

The entire system is designed to provide a fast, minimal, transparent way to
enter fully configured cloud developer environments with zero manual setup.

## What SteadyState Provides

### 1. Reproducible Environments

SteadyState builds development environments from repository definitions such as:

* `flake.nix`
* `default.nix` / `shell.nix`
* (future) `requirements.txt`, `renv.lock`, `uv.lock`, etc.

These environments run remotely and are defined declaratively for consistent, deterministic behavior.

### 2. Ephemeral, On-Demand Sessions

Users can request a fresh environment at any time.
Each session:

* Runs in the cloud (initial target: Hetzner)
* Is short-lived by default
* Automatically cleans up after use
* Provides a complete dev environment without any local dependencies

### 3. Collaborative Access

Each session exposes a multi-user SSH endpoint through an embedded collaboration
layer (using [Upterm](https://upterm.dev/)). This allows:

* Pair programming
* Live debugging
* Working from any editor (VS Code, Neovim, Emacs, etc.)

Environments ship with [ne](https://github.com/vigna/ne/), the nice editor, for
users who want a minimal in-terminal editor without needing an SSH-aware GUI.

### 4. Authentication System

The backend implements OAuth Device Flow authentication.
The architecture is designed to support:

* GitHub (MVP)
* GitLab (future)
* Orchid (future)
* Enterprise identity providers (future)

Authentication uses short-lived JWTs with long-lived refresh tokens stored securely by the CLI.

## Repository Structure

```
steadystate/
├── cli/            # Rust CLI: authentication, session management
├── backend/        # Rust backend: auth providers, session orchestration
├── common/         # Shared types and utilities (planned)
└── flake.nix       # Reproducible development environment for all components
```

* The **CLI** and **Backend** are independent Rust crates.
* The **flake.nix** provides consistent dev and build tooling across the project.
* A shared crate (`common/`) will consolidate types, JWT logic, and error structures across components.

## Design Philosophy

### Minimal local state

Everything needed for development lives in the remote environment.

### Ephemeral by default

Every session starts clean and predictable.

### Transparent and scriptable

SteadyState is a *tool*, not a platform you must commit to.
Both CLI and backend expose simple interfaces that integrate with existing workflows.

### Reproducibility above all

Nix is used to define and build environments in a controlled, deterministic way.
For non-Nix users, `steadystate` will try to bootstrap the environment from
common lock files.

### Editor-agnostic collaboration

SSH is the backbone. Bring your own editor, or use `ne`.

### Collaboration Modes

SteadyState supports two distinct modes for collaboration:

#### 1. Pair Programming (`--mode=pair`)
*   **Powered by Upterm**: Creates a secure SSH tunnel to the host's terminal.
*   **Shared Terminal**: All users share the same terminal session and file system state.
*   **Ideal for**: Real-time pair programming, debugging, and teaching.

#### 2. Shared Workspace (`--mode=collab`)
*   **Shared Host, Isolated Worktrees**: All users connect to the same compute instance but work in their own isolated Git worktrees.
*   **Canonical Repository**: A central bare repository (`canonical`) acts as the synchronization point.
*   **Conflict-Free Sync Model**:
    *   **Session Branch Isolation**: Each session operates on a dedicated Git branch (`steadystate/collab/<session_id>`), isolating session work from the upstream `main` branch.
    *   **Y-CRDT Merge Engine**: `steadystate sync` uses a Yjs/Yrs-based CRDT merge engine to perform conflict-free 3-way merges (Base, Local, Canonical) for text files. This ensures that concurrent edits from multiple users are merged deterministically without manual conflict resolution.
    *   **Git Integration**: The merged result is committed to the session branch. Users can merge the session branch back to `main` via standard Pull Requests after the session.
*   **Ideal for**: Async collaboration, dividing work on the same feature, and avoiding "it works on my machine" issues.

## Components

### CLI

* Handles OAuth device flow login (`login`)
* Shows the authenticated identity (`whoami`)
* Refreshes and revokes tokens
* Creates development sessions (`up`)
* Supports a `--noenv` mode for fast, editor-only sessions

### Backend

* Manages authentication via modular providers
* Issues and validates JWTs
* Creates and tracks ephemeral dev sessions
* Provides an API consumed by the CLI
